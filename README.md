Swings

A web platform designed to connect students with "solvers" for assistance with academic tasks like assignments, presentations, and projects. This platform serves as the primary marketing and initial contact point for the service.

üìñ Description
In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often face tight deadlines and a heavy workload, especially around exam periods. This project, the Academic Assistance Platform, aims to provide a solution by creating a marketplace where students can outsource their academic tasks to skilled individuals (solvers).

The website acts as a storefront, building trust and showcasing the services offered. The core business logic and customer interaction are handled externally through a direct communication channel like WhatsApp to maintain simplicity and a personal touch. The business owner acts as an intermediary, ensuring quality and facilitating communication between the student and the solver.
